=== Running Prometheus on CF

You can check out https://github.com/making/cf-grafana[Toshiaki Maki's code] on how to automate Grafana installation on CF.

Go to https://prometheus.io/download/ and download linux binary. Then call:

```
cf push sc-pipelines-prometheus -b binary_buildpack -c './prometheus -web.listen-address=:8080' -m 64m
```

Also `localhost:9090` in `prometheus.yml` should be `localhost:8080`.

The file should look like this to work with the demo setup (change `github-analytics-sc-pipelines.cfapps.io`
to your `github-analytics` installation).

```yml
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
      monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"
  # - "second.rules"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']

  - job_name: 'demo-app'

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s

    metrics_path: '/prometheus'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['github-analytics-sc-pipelines.cfapps.io']
```

=== Running Grafana on CF

You can check out https://github.com/making/cf-grafana[Toshiaki Maki's code] on how to automate Prometheus installation on CF.

Download tarball from https://grafana.com/grafana/download?platform=linux
Next set `http_port = 8080` in `conf/default.ini`. Then call

```
cf push sc-pipelines-grafana -b binary_buildpack -c './bin/grafana-server web' -m 64m
```

The demo is using Grafana Dashboard with ID `2471`.
